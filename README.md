1. Problem Statement:  
Current transportation systems that use IoT face cybersecurity risks because of:  
Massive data exchange between vehicles, sensors, and the cloud  
Insufficient anomaly detection methods  
A lack of real-time threat information that adapts to changes

2.Â Introduction:
The emergence of IoT-powered smart transportation networks has revolutionized the way data is gathered, exchanged, and processed across infrastructure, sensors, and automobiles. Collectively referred to as the Internet of Transportation Systems (IoTS), these systems rely on cloud platforms to handle massive amounts of real-time data in order to make effective decisions. But there are also serious cybersecurity issues brought on by this greater connectedness. System integrity and user safety are seriously threatened by cyberthreats like denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, spoofing, and data tampering.
This project suggests creating an AI-driven cybersecurity framework to allay these worries. The objective is to identify suspicious activity, react to threats in real-time, and protect the transportation network from potential vulnerabilities by combining machine learning and cloud analytics.

3.Methodology (Initial Stage Plan):  
Step 1: Reviewed literature on IoT, cloud security, and AI applications.  
Step 2: Choose datasets for simulating cyberattacks in transportation systems.  
Step 3: Design the system setup, including IoT nodes, cloud service, and AI secrity layer.  
Step 4: Build an initial model for machine learning-based anomaly detection, using methods like Random Forest, SVM, or LSTM.  
Step 5: Implement secure data transmission with encryption algorithms like AES and RSA.  

4. Tools and Technologies:  
Programming: Python  
AI/ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras  
Cloud: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud (simulation)  
IoT Simulators: Cisco Packet Tracer, Node-RED, MATLAB Simulink  
Cybersecurity Libraries: PyCryptodome, OpenSSL
